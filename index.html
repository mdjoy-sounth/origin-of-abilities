        <h2>Who Is God and How the Abilities Work</h2>
        <p>Everything that exists in the world has its own laws and abilities. Humans cannot survive without oxygen and food. Our eyes capture what we see automatically. Just like that, abilities also exist in the world, and we do not have the right to deny these truths.</p>
        <p>The brain cannot stop hearing Sounth, seeing Visual Mind Illusion, or prevent others from using Ovjarb because every brain is connected to the world. These abilities operate through the world, which is why we cannot stop other people from using them.</p>
        <p>Some people say they have a sixth sense because their brain has a stronger link with the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Who Is God?</h2>
        <p>Does God exist? And why do multiple religions exist? Religions were created by people with a deeper connection to the world. They understood that God is the world itself, and everything is connected through it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Hell and Heaven</h2>
        <p><strong>Hell exists</strong> to punish those who commit crimes in the world. It is part of the world's laws.</p>
        <p><strong>Heaven:</strong> I do not know because God has not given me permission to know it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Ghosts and Dark Energy</h2>
        <p>Ghosts do not exist, but dark energy does. Dark energy is created from dark thoughts of living beings and can harm others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What Happens in Hell?</h2>
        <p>In hell, a person's bones are repeatedly broken. After death or every twelve hours, the body is restored, and the suffering continues. This prevents the body from adapting to pain and implants a constant fear within the mind.</p>
        <p>The idea of hell differs by religion because it depends on the belief structure created by its founders. This is why multiple religions exist.</p>
